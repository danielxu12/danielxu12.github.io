I am a full-time student at SUNY Geneseo, majoring in Economics with a minor in Data Analytics within the AACSB-accredited School of Business. I am actively seeking a Data Analyst or Business Analyst internship to gain hands-on experience and explore my passion for these fields.

My peers and mentors often describe me as hardworking, organized, and possessing strong communication skills. I am eager to contribute these qualities to a dynamic team. <br>
